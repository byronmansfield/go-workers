# Go Workers Example

A simple proof of concept for porting ruby workers to sidekiq compatible go workers. Hopefully after completing this project we can see how to implement go workers within a ruby project and call them directly. As an added benifit we will also have some benchmarks to show the speed advantages to moving to this model. As it is one of the driving factors for this POC.

### ToDo's
